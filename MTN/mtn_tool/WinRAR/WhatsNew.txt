                WinRAR - What's new in the latest version


   Version 5.70

   1. "Files to process" option on "Time" page of archiving dialog
      allows to choose files based on modification, creation or last access
      file time. Previously it was possible for modification time only.
   
   2. Command line -ta, -tb, -tn, -to switches accept 'm', 'c' and 'a'
      modifiers after the switch name. So file time conditions can include
      not only the file modification time as in previous versions,
      but also creation and last access time.

      Such switch can include multiple modifiers to set the same date
      for all specified times. For example, -tamc20190215 will process files
      modified and created after 2019-02-15. 
      
      New 'o' modifier permits to switch from AND to OR logic,
      so -tamco20190215 includes files modified or created after 2019-02-15.
      It is also allowed to specify several time filtering switches
      with different dates in the same command line, like:
      -taco20190201 -tbmo20190210

      Switches -ta and -tn also include files matching the specified date
      exactly. Switches -tb and -to exclude such files.

   3. WinRAR file list can display creation and last access file times
      if they are available.

      Creation and last access columns are disabled by default and can be
      enabled in "Select file list columns" dialog. This dialog is opened
      after right clicking on file list column headers or after pressing
      "File list/Files/Columns..." button in WinRAR settings.

   4. "Double extensions for archives" and "Archives in subfolders"
      options on "Files" page of archiving dialog modify behavior of 
      "Put each file to separate archive" option.

      You can switch between archive names in filename.ext.rar
      and filename.rar style with "Double extensions for archives".

      You can create a separate archive for every file in selected subfolders
      or store the entire contents of every selected folder in separate
      archive depending on the state of "Archives in subfolders" option.

   5. New -ad1 switch can be used when unpacking multiple archives
      recursively, such as 'rar x -r -ad1 arc\*.rar'. It creates
      a separate folder for files unpacked from each archive,
      but unlike already existing -ad switch, it creates such folders
      in each archive folder.

   6. If context menu "Extract each archive to separate folder" is applied
      to archives from different folders in Windows Explorer "Search results",
      subfolders with unpacked files are created in each archive folder.
      Previous versions created them all in a folder of right clicked archive.
   
   7. New "File list/List style/Checkboxes" option in WinRAR settings
      allows to use checkboxes to select file list items.

   8. New "File list/Files/Exact sizes" option in WinRAR settings.

      If this option is on, file sizes are always displayed in bytes.
      If it is off, sizes are rounded up and use units such as KB or MB.
      Smaller files can be still displayed in bytes.

   9. If several console RAR are started with -ioff switch, PC is turned off
      by RAR copy finished last. Previously this switch was processed
      by first finished copy.

  10. Read and write buffer size is increased for .iso files.
      It can help to improve .iso extraction performance in some cases,
      such as for network drives.

  11. If "Delete archive" option in extraction dialog is applied to a set
      of RAR and REV volumes in volname.part# format, WinRAR will delete
      REV volumes as well. Previously only RAR volumes were deleted
      keeping REV files intact.

  12. If "Delete archive" option in extraction dialog is applied to set
      of ZIP volumes with .zip.001, .zip.002, .zip.003 extensions,
      WinRAR will delete all ZIP volumes. Previously only .zip.001 volume
      was deleted for such volume naming scheme.

  13. If we unpack arcname.rar using "Extract to arcname\" Explorer context
      menu command and "arcname" file already exists, WinRAR shell extension
      will propose "Extract to arcname~1\" instead. Previously this context
      menu command attempted to create a folder with same name as already
      existing file and failed.

  14. If we pack a shortcut file with .lnk extension from Explorer context
      menu, .lnk file itself is added to archive. Previous versions added
      .lnk file target instead of .lnk file.

  15. Windows does not allow executables exceeding 4 GB, so WinRAR issues
      an error immediately when attempting to create 4 GB or larger
      RAR SFX volumes. Previously WinRAR issued such error only after
      creating the first RAR volume.

  16. Total extraction progress is displayed for 7z multivolume archives. 
      Accuracy of 7z total extraction progress is improved.

  17. "Find" command "Disks and folders" drop down list has been renamed
      to "Search area". Additionally to already existing choices,
      it includes a new "Selected items" option restricting search
      to files and folders selected in WinRAR file list.

  18. "Find" command displays the number of found items in status bar.

  19. "Diagnostic messages" window displays archive names in a separate
      column to provide the better message visibility for lengthy
      archive names.
   
  20. Switch -isnd[-] in command line WinRAR mode allows to override
      "Enable sound" option in WinRAR settings. Use -isnd to turn sound
      notifications on and -isnd- to turn them off.

  21. Nadav Grossman from Check Point Software Technologies informed us
      about a security vulnerability in UNACEV2.DLL library.
      Aforementioned vulnerability makes possible to create files
      in arbitrary folders inside or outside of destination folder
      when unpacking ACE archives.

      WinRAR used this third party library to unpack ACE archives.
      UNACEV2.DLL had not been updated since 2005 and we do not have access
      to its source code. So we decided to drop ACE archive format support
      to protect security of WinRAR users.

      We are thankful to Check Point Software Technologies for reporting
      this issue.
   
  22. Bugs fixed:

      a) console RAR mixed up source and destination file sizes and times
         in the overwrite prompt when updating a file in RAR archive
         with -o switch;

      b) dragging files from 32-bit applications to 64-bit WinRAR window
         did not work;

      c) WinRAR Shift+Del command applied to a folder could fail to delete
         some its subfolders. This command is used to delete files and folders
         permanently instead of moving them to Recycle Bin;

      d) folder tree panel could not change folders if archived pathnames
         started from path separator, such as in archives created by tar tool
         with --absolute-names option;

      e) if relative "Path=.\somefolder" was specified in SFX comment
         and SFX archive needed to elevate privileges when extracting,
         it created 'somefolder\somefolder' instead of 'somefolder';

      f) commands modifying an existing RAR4 volume reset the volume number
         field to 1. While it did not affect extraction, WinRAR displayed
         a wrong volume number for such volumes;

      g) fixed a crash when reading a comment from a corrupt RAR file;

      h) toolbar in "Find" command "Search results" window was not adjusted
         to different toolbar icon sizes properly.


   Version 5.61

   1. "Delete archive" extraction option deletes all volumes even if user
      started extraction from non-first RAR volume, but first volume
      is present and all files are unpacked successfully. In such case
      previous versions ignored "Delete archive" even if WinRAR was able
      to locate the first volume and process the volume set from beginning.
   
   2. Compression ratio bar is not displayed on "Archive" page of
      Explorer file properties for archives with encrypted file names.
      WinRAR cannot reliably calculate it for such archives without
      a password and previously it just displayed 0% here.
   
   3. Bugs fixed:

      a) WinRAR displayed "The specified password is incorrect" message
         infinitely when attempting to open RAR5 archive with encrypted
         file names if wrong global password was set with Ctrl+P;

      b) memory management bug in the password dialog could lead to
         access to already freed memory followed by crash.
         This issue may be also associated with security risks;

      c) fixed crashes in corrupt RAR, ACE and LZH archives.
         This issue may be also associated with security risks;

      d) while starting, WinRAR could cause a brief flickering in menu bars
         of few other applications;

      e) WinRAR "Find" command matched "String to find" against all
         archived files ignoring "File names to find" mask when searching
         in CAB archives;

      f) SFX module "License" command did not set a title of license window;

      g) if "Start-up folder" in WinRAR settings included the trailing
         backslash, WinRAR ignored first "Up one level" command.
         

   Version 5.60

   1. We updated WinRAR graphics.

      We are grateful to http://weirdsgn.com and http://icondesignlab.com
      designers participated in this endeavor and proud to announce that
      WinRAR uses the new icon set prepared by Aditya Nugraha Putra
      from http://weirdsgn.com.

      Previous WinRAR icons are available as interface theme here:
      https://rarlab.com/themes/WinRAR_Classic_48x36.theme.rar
   
   2. "Repair" command efficiency is improved for recovery record protected
      RAR5 archives. Now it can detect deletions and insertions of unlimited
      size also as shuffled data including data taken from several recovery
      record protected archives and merged into a single file in arbitrary
      order.
   
   3. "Turn PC off when done" archiving option is changed to "When done"
      drop down list, so you can turn off, hibernate or sleep your PC
      after completing archiving.

   4. Use -ioff or -ioff1 command line switch to turn PC off,
      -ioff2 to hibernate and -ioff3 to sleep your PC after completing
      an operation.

   5. If encoding of comment file specified in -z<file> switch is not
      defined with -sc switch, RAR attempts to detect UTF-8, UTF-16LE
      and UTF-16BE encodings based on the byte order mask and data
      validity tests.

   6. WinRAR attempts to detect ANSI, OEM and UTF-8 encodings of
      ZIP archive comments automatically.
   
   7. "Internal viewer/Use DOS encoding" option in "Settings/Viewer"
      is replaced with "Internal viewer/Autodetect encoding".
      If "Autodetect encoding" is enabled, the internal viewer attempts
      to detect ANSI (Windows), OEM (DOS), UTF-8 and UTF-16 encodings.

   8. Normally Windows Explorer context menu contains only extraction
      commands if single archive has been right clicked. You can override
      this by specifying one or more space separated masks in "Always display
      archiving items for" option in Settings/Integration/Context menu items",
      so archiving commands are always displayed for these file types
      even if file was recognized as archive. If you wish both archiving
      and extraction commands present for all archives, place "*" here.
   
   9. SFX module "SetupCode" command accepts an optional integer parameter
      allowing to control mapping of setup program and SFX own error codes.
      It is also accessible as "Exit code adjustment" option
      in "Advanced SFX options/Setup" dialog.
   
  10. New "Show more information" WinRAR command line -im switch.
      It can be used with "t" command to issue a message also in case of
      successful archive test result. Without this switch "t" command
      completes silently if no errors are found.

      This switch is applicable only to WinRAR.exe and ignored by console
      RAR.exe.

  11. If a wrong password is entered when unpacking an encrypted file
      in ZIP archive, WinRAR proposes to enter a valid password
      for same file again instead of aborting extraction.

  12. If a wrong password is entered when opening or unpacking RAR archive
      with encrypted file names, WinRAR proposes to enter a valid password
      again instead of aborting the operation. Previous versions already
      did so for RAR archives with encrypted file data, but aborted
      for archives with file name encryption.

  13. WinRAR recognizes GZIP files with arbitrary data preceding
      an actual GZIP archive, such as .scexe firmware files.

  14. @filelist parameter can be specified in "Files to add" field of
      archiving dialog. In this case WinRAR will attempt the list of archiving
      files from 'filelist' file, which should be the plain text, one file
      name per line.

  15. Info dialog:
      
      a) compression ratio graph is updated;

      b) "Names and data" is displayed in "Encryption" field for
         archives with encrypted file names.

  16. Full archive name is displayed if mouse pointer is placed over
      an archive name in the operation progress window. It can be useful
      if archive name is lengthy and does not fit to available window space.

  17. If -ts1 switch is used with -u or -f, file time comparison is performed
      with 1 second precision. Previosuly in such case we could wrongly treat
      an adding file as newer than archived just because we compared the high
      precision adding file time against the low precision archived file time.

  18. "Update" and "Fresh" commands ('u' and 'f' in the command line mode)
      quit immediately if no files are to be updated. Previously they created
      a temporary archive before quitting when updating archives with recovery
      record or quick open information.

  19. Prompt is issued after creating 500 volumes from WinRAR GUI shell,
      so user can continue or quit further archiving. It is done to prevent
      creating many thousands of volumes in case of wrongly entered
      volume size.

  20. WinRAR uses megabytes instead of bytes as default units for volume size
      field in the archiving dialog.

  21. "Repair" command issues "Recovery record is corrupt" message
      after repairing RAR5 archive containing a broken recovery record.
      Previously such message was issued only by "Test" command
      and "Repair" handled most of recovery record damages silently.

  22. Bugs fixed:

      a) fixed potential security issues when processing corrupt
         RAR archives;
      
      b) non-English characters in TAR files with PAX extended headers
         were not displayed correctly;

      c) "rar x arcname.rar .." command unpacked files to current folder
         instead of its parent;

      d) pasting files from Windows Explorer to archive opened in WinRAR
         blocked further copy and paste operations in Explorer until
         archiving was finished;

      e) SFX module issued "The specified password is incorrect" message
         infinitely not prompting for correct password once a wrong password
         was entered;

      f) folders time was always set when extracting ZIP archives even if
         "File time" options in the extraction dialog were turned off;

      g) if "Delete archive: Always" was selected when extracting
         and user pressed "Cancel" in the file overwrite or password prompt,
         an archive could be deleted even after cancelling extraction
         for .zip and .7z formats.

   
   Version 5.50

   1. WinRAR and command line RAR use RAR 5.0 archive format by default.
      You can change it to RAR 4.x compatible format with "RAR4" option
      in archiving dialog or -ma4 command line switch.
      
      If you prefer RAR 4.x format by default, use "Create default..."
      button on "Compression" page of WinRAR settings and set "RAR4"
      in the displayed dialog.

      This change affects only new clean installs. If you already saved
      RAR format in the default compression profile in previous versions,
      WinRAR respects stored settings.
   
   2. Use "Set master password" button in "Organize passwords" dialog
      to encrypt saved password records and protect them from unauthorized
      access. 
      
      If saved passwords are protected with master password, you need to
      enter the master password and press "OK" in password prompt to access
      them. If entered password does not match the master password,
      it is treated as a usual password for archive operations.

      Once entered, the master password is valid until WinRAR is closed.
      Close WinRAR and open it again after specifying the master password
      if you wish to see how protection works. Enter a valid and then
      empty master password to remove encryption from previously protected
      password records.

      This WinRAR version uses a new data format for password organizer,
      so passwords stored in "Organize passwords" dialog are not readable
      by older versions. It does not affect archive encryption formats
      and encrypted archives are compatible with previous WinRAR version.
      Organizer data is converted to a new format only when you save it
      and not immediately after installing WinRAR.

   3. Prompt proposing to set the master password is displayed
      when storing a password in compression profile. You can enter
      the master password to encrypt password data stored in Registry
      and protect it from unauthorized access. You will need to enter
      the master password in password prompt dialog to access
      such compression profile after that.

      Once entered, the master password is valid until WinRAR is closed.
      Close WinRAR and open it again after specifying the master password
      if you wish to see how protection works.

   4. By default, WinRAR uses AES-256 in CTR mode to encrypt ZIP archives.
      While AES-256 is significantly more secure than ZIP 2.0 legacy
      encryption algorithm, it can be incompatible with some older
      unzip software. If compatibility with such tools is required,
      you can enable "ZIP legacy encryption" option in the password
      dialog or use -mezl switch in the command line mode. 
   
   5. Added extraction support for .LZ archives created by Lzip compressor.
   
   6. Modern TAR tools can store high precision file times, lengthy
      file names and large file sizes in special PAX extended headers
      inside of TAR archive. Now WinRAR supports such PAX headers
      and uses them when extracting TAR archives.

   7. New "Store modification time" option on "Time" page of archiving
      dialog can be used to prohibit storing the file modification time
      in RAR 5.x archives. Former "High precision modification time"
      option is replaced by "High precision time format".

   8. New "Full paths in title bar" option in "Settings/General" dialog.
      If enabled, the full path of currently opened folder or archive
      is displayed in WinRAR title bar.

   9. New "File types to open as archives first" option
      in "Settings/Compression". Here you can define how Enter
      or double click on a file with non-archive extension and archive
      contents should be processed in WinRAR file list in file
      management mode. Examples of such files are .docx or self-extracting
      .exe archives. You can instruct WinRAR either to open such files
      as archives first or to execute or open them in associated programs.

      Default settings are to open self-extracting exe and to run
      other types of archives with non-archive extension.

      Regardless of these options, you can always open any such 
      archive file by pressing Ctrl+PgDn on its name in WinRAR file list.

      Default folders for archives and extracted files are moved
      from "Settings/Compression" to "Settings/Paths".

  10. New "Copy full names to clipboard" command in "File" menu
      places full names of selected files to clipboard.      

  11. Changes in the context menu displayed when right clicking
      the file list in WinRAR:

      a) several commands, which are also present on the toolbar
         or in main menu, such as "View" and "Repair", are removed
         from this context menu;

      b) "Copy full names to clipboard" command is added;

      c) "Run" for executables, "Open in associated application"
         for associated files and "Show archive contents" for archives
         are added. They allow to choose a way to process SFX archives
         and archive files with non-archive extensions.

         These items are present only in the file management mode
         and are not available inside of archives.

  12. LZ and ZIPX are added to list of associations in Settings/Integration
      dialog.

  13. LZ and ZIPX extensions are added to default list of formats for
      -ms switch ("Specify file types to store") invoked without parameters.

  14. You can specify 'f' charset value in -sc switch to use UTF-8
      encoding. For example:

      rar a -scfl arcname @filelist.txt

      to read contents of filelist.txt as UTF-8 text.

  15. RAR "lt" and "vt" commands display file times with nanosecond
      precision. Such precision is used in RAR5 archives created
      by RAR/Unix 5.50 and newer. Archives created by WinRAR have 100ns
      file time precision.

  16. Only '+', '-' and '1' precision modifiers are supported
      in -ts switch now. Use '+' to store the file time with maximum
      precision, '-' to omit the file time and '1' to store it with
      1 second precision. Intermediate precision modes previously
      defined with '2' and '3' modifiers are not available in RAR 5.0
      archive format and ignored by -ts switch.

  17. If a wrong password is entered when unpacking an encrypted file
      in RAR5 archive, WinRAR proposes to enter a valid password
      for same file again instead of aborting extraction.
   
  18. File path information is displayed if mouse pointer is placed over
      a name of archiving file in the operation progress window.

  19. Name of currently active compression profile is displayed
      in the archiving dialog above "Profiles..." button.

  20. If "Find" command is invoked from inside of archive subfolder,
      "File names to find" will include the path to this subfolder.
      So "Find" will search only starting from this subfolder.

  21. Bugs fixed:
   
      a) fixed crashes and security vulnerability when unpacking corrupt
         RAR archives;

      b) WinRAR failed to unpack files in ZIP archives compressed
         with XZ algorithm and encrypted with AES;
      
      c) if "Windows progress bars" option in WinRAR settings was turned off
         and "Put each file to separate archive" archiving mode was used,
         "gold" part of total progress bar did not display the compressed
         data ratio correctly;

      d) SFX archive extraction progress was incorrect in case of
         multivolume SFX archive with total volume size exceeding 4 GB;

      e) if archived folder name included trailing spaces, if user
         selected and extracted some folders in non-root archive folder
         and if "Allow potentially incompatible names" extraction option
         was turned off, WinRAR could lose one or more leading characters
         in extracted folder name;

      f) if only creation or only last access file time was stored in RAR5
         archive with 1 second precision, such as with -ma5 -tsm- -tsa1
         switches, this stored time was ignored when extracting.


   Version 5.40

   1. "Name encoding" submenu in "Options" menu allows to select
      encoding for archived file names. This selection affects archive
      browsing and extraction commands. You can use Ctrl+E keyboard
      shortcut to access this menu quickly.

      It can be useful when unpacking an archive without Unicode file names.
      For example, unpacking a zip file with Chinese archived names
      in Windows with Russian specified as a language for non-Unicode
      programs.

   2. If RAR recovery volumes (.rev files) are present in the same folder
      as usual RAR volumes, archive test command verifies .rev contents
      after completing testing .rar files.

      If you wish to test only .rev files without checking .rar volumes,
      you can select .rev files in WinRAR file list and apply "Test"
      only to them or run:

      rar t arcname.part1.rev

      in the command line.

   3. While NTFS file system permits file names with trailing spaces
      and dots, a lot of Windows programs fail to process such names
      correctly. If "Allow potentially incompatible names" option
      in "Advanced" page of extraction dialog is turned off, WinRAR removes
      trailing spaces and dots, if any, from file names when extracting.

      This option is turned off by default.

      Command line RAR also removes trailing spaces and dots when extracting
      unless -oni switch is specified.
   
   4. Previously "Synchronize archive contents" update mode
      (-as command line switch) aborted if some of archiving folders
      could not be read. Now WinRAR continues performing the operation
      and preserves archived files matching unreadable folders.

   5. WinRAR Shift+Del delete command can be used to delete folders
      containing non-standard file names with trailing spaces and dots.
      Usual delete to Recycle Bin also as Shift+Del in previous WinRAR
      versions cannot delete such folders.

      Unlike Del command, Shift+Del removes files permanently,
      they are not moved to Recycle Bin. No additional prompts are issued
      for files with read-only and system attributes.

   6. You can drag folders from folder tree panel and drop them to
      other programs or Desktop to copy or unpack them. Drag the archive
      icon in tree panel root to unpack the entire archive.
   
   7. "New folder" button in extraction dialog proposes a new folder name
      based on archive name instead of generic "New Folder".

   8. Command line RAR version information:
   
      a) if -iver switch is specified, RAR displays the version number
         and quits. You can run just "RAR -iver";

      b) "x86" or "x64" is displayed in Windows RAR version information
         both for -iver and in the copyright title for other commands.
   
   9. If -p switch is used without optional <pwd> parameter,
      a password can be also set with file redirection or pipe.

      For example: rar -p myarc.rar myfiles < psw.txt

  10. Command line RAR treats 'arcname.partN' as 'arcname.partN.rar'
      if 'arcname.partN' does not exist and 'arcname.part#.rar' exists.

      For example, it is allowed to run:

      RAR x arcname.part01

      to start extraction from arcname.part01.rar
   
  11. Improvements in 7z archives support:
   
      a) "Solid" status is correctly detected and reported for 7z archives
         in WinRAR "Info" command;

      b) dictionary size is displayed for LZMA and LZMA2 7z archives
         in WinRAR "Info" command;

      c) unknown packed size for files inside of 7z solid block is denoted
         as '?' instead of '0' when browsing the archive contents in WinRAR.
   
  12. Maximum comment length for RAR archives is increased from 64 to 256 KB.

      Since SFX script commands are stored in archive comment,
      it allows a longer main and license text in SFX archives.

  13. Size of default WinRAR viewer font is scaled up properly
      in Windows high DPI mode.

  14. Switch -scul can be used to process big endian UTF-16 list files
      as well, provided that they have a correct byte order mark.
      Previously it allowed only little endian file lists.

  15. Minimum supported Windows version is Windows XP SP3 now.
      WinRAR will not run in Windows XP without service packs.

  16. "Settings/File list/Allow all uppercase names" option is removed.
      This option was intended to simplify transition from MS DOS to
      Windows and is not needed anymore.

  17. Bugs fixed:
   
      a) WinRAR 5.31 x64 "Compress and email" command did not work
         with Microsoft Outlook x64;

      b) if WinRAR 5.31 version for one of right to left languages
         was installed in Windows with English or other not right to
         left system language, WinRAR could change Windows Explorer
         layout to right to left;

      c) if archive was stored in a folder without "Write" permission
         and if archive contents was extracted with drag and drop to
         a writable folder, WinRAR issued an unnecessary privileges
         elevation prompt.

   
   Version 5.31

   1. Following issues are corrected in Windows high DPI mode:

      a) if text size in Windows settings was set to 150% or larger,
         the font size in WinRAR help was not increased accordingly,
         resulting in too small text;

      b) default columns width in WinRAR file list was less
         than expected for 125% or larger Windows text setting.

   2. Interface improvements for right to left languages:

      a) proper text alignment in simple WinRAR prompts, such as
         confirmations to delete archived files or to clear the log file;

      b) "OK", "Cancel", "Help" buttons in multi-page dialogs,
         such as archiving and extraction options or WinRAR settings,
         are aligned correctly and translated to default Windows
         display language.

   3. Bugs fixed:

      a) WinRAR SFX module could load DLL libraries from its own executable
         folder as a result of calling some Windows API functions.
         It could lead to security threat if DLL files with malicious code
         were stored in the same folder as SFX archive. Now SFX module
         takes additional steps to prevent such situation in Windows Vista
         and newer.

         Be aware that users without latest Windows security patches
         installed also as Windows XP users still can be affected,
         so they must be especially careful to run SFX archive from
         a folder without suspicious DLL files;
      
      b) WinRAR 5.30 failed to run .lnk files from file list.

   
   Version 5.30

   1. Information about the critical vulnerability in WinRAR self-extracting
      archives published in news in September and October 2015 is incorrect.
      Unfortunately mass media failed to recognize that what was described
      as WinRAR vulnerability is Windows OLE vulnerability patched
      in November 2014:

      https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms14-064.aspx

      Even if unpatched, this Windows OLE vulnerability does not introduce
      new risk factors for WinRAR SFX archives.

      Please read http://rarlab.com/vuln_sfx_html2.htm for more details.

      No patches for WinRAR are needed.

   2. Added extraction of multipart ZIP archives created by 7-Zip.
      Such archives have .zip.001, .zip.002, ... file extensions.
      You need to open .zip.001 file in WinRAR shell to browse 
      or unpack such archive. All parts must be stored in the same folder
      before starting extraction.

   3. Added extraction of files split to multiple parts with .001,
      .002, ..., extensions. You can open .001 file as a usual archive
      and then unpack its contents. WinRAR will combine all parts
      and save them to extracted file. All parts must be stored
      in the same folder before starting extraction.

      "001" item is included to "Associate WinRAR with" list
      in "Settings/Integration" dialog.
         
   4. WinRAR file list allows to use mouse Back and Forward buttons
      or Alt+Left and Alt+Right keyboard shortcuts to navigate
      in recently visited folders.

   5. Folder wildcards are allowed in RAR command line in file names to
      archive. For example:

      rar a backup c:\backup\2015*\*

      will archive all '2015*' folders in c:\backup. Use -r switch to search
      for '2015*' also in c:\backup subfolders.

   6. "Extract" button in SFX archive is changed to "Pause" when extraction
      is started, so it is possible to pause SFX extraction and resume it
      later.

   7. "Skip encrypted" option in "Find files" dialog to silently skip
      encrypted archives while performing search command.
   
   8. Archive test command works for tar.gz, tar.bz2 and tar.xz archives.
      Since TAR format does not provide file data checksums, WinRAR checks
      only validity of GZIP, BZIP2 or XZ container.
   
   9. Adding a new string to WinRAR diagnostic messages window could be
      slow and affect the operation performance in case of thousands
      of errors. Now it works fast regardless of errors number.

  10. New 'R' object for -sc switch defines encoding of console
      RAR messages sent to redirected files and pipes. For example:

      rar lb -scur data > list.txt

      will produce Unicode list.txt with archived file names.

  11. Sleep time parameter in -ri<priority>[:<sleep_time>] switch is
      adjusted to lower its impact to RAR performance and especially
      to recovery record related operations. Higher sleep time values
      are needed to reduce the system load to same level as
      in previous versions.

  12. Console RAR "l" and "v" commands display file time in YYYY-MM-DD
      format.

  13. When extracting RAR and ZIP archives created in Unix, WinRAR maps
      decomposed Unicode characters to precomposed. Such conversion
      is required for some Unix and OS X archives to correctly unpack
      non-English archived names in Windows. It works for Windows versions
      starting from Windows Vista.

  14. Modification time is set for all folders created when unpacking
      .7z archives. Previous versions set it only for non-empty folders.

  15. WinRAR prevents a computer to go to sleep by inactivity timeout
      until current operation, such as archiving, extraction or another
      archive processing, is done.

  16. Total progress bar is displayed when extracting .arj, .lzh and .cab
      archives (except multivolume archives).

  17. Progress bar is displayed when deleting files after archiving
      and when clearing "Archive" attribute of archived files.

  18. "Test" command also verifies contents of NTFS alternate data streams
      in RAR 3.x - 5.x archives. Previously their contents was checked
      only during extraction command.

  19. SFX module sets sfxstime environment variable, which contains
      the module start time in "YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS-ms" format.
      You can specify it in Path command if you need to generate a time
      based unique installation path, such as "Path=myapp-%sfxstime%".

  20. Bugs fixed:

      a) console RAR crashed instead of displaying an overwrite prompt
         when attempting to add files to already existing volumes;

      b) console RAR "lt" command did not display seconds in file timestamp;

      c) WinRAR failed to decompress .xxe files if they did not include
         "section N of xxencode" string in the body;

      d) WinRAR could not restore contents of NTFS alternate data stream
         saved with -os switch if it was split between different volumes.


   Version 5.21

   1. "Drag and drop context menu" options in "Settings/Integration/
      Context menu items" dialog allow to disable WinRAR archiving
      and extraction commands in context menu displayed after dragging
      and dropping files with right mouse button.

   2. If winrar.ini file is present in the same folder as WinRAR installer,
      winrar.ini will be copied to WinRAR program folder after completing
      installation.

   3. While previous versions could produce RAR5 volumes of slightly
      smaller than requested size sometimes, such situation is less
      likely now. In most cases volume size equals to specified by user.

   4. Now by default WinRAR skips symbolic links with absolute paths
      in link target when extracting. You can enable creating such links
      with "Allow absolute paths in symbolic links" option on "Advanced"
      page of extraction dialog or with -ola command line switch.

      Such links pointing to folders outside of extraction destination
      folder can present a security risk. Enable their extraction only
      if you are sure that archive contents is safe, such as your own backup.
      
   5. Bugs fixed:

      a) WinRAR 5.20 issued unnecessary user account control (UAC) prompt,
         when running an executable from archive stored in UAC protected
         folder. Since nothing is extracted to folder containing an archive
         in such case, UAC prompt is not needed;

      b) WinRAR could overwrite files with read-only attribute only
         when unpacking RAR and ZIP archive formats. Now it is also
         implemented for other archive formats supported by WinRAR;

      c) "Elapsed time" and "Time left" were displayed incorrectly
         when applying "Convert" command to multiple archives
         and enabling "Add recovery record" option.

   
   Version 5.20

   1. If Windows User Account Control prevents extracting or archiving
      commands to create files in system protected folders, WinRAR attempts
      to start its another copy with administrator privileges to complete
      the operation. It is necessary to confirm privileges elevation
      in response to User Account Control prompt to allow such second
      WinRAR copy to run.

   2. You can drag files in Explorer with right mouse button, drop them
      to some folder and select WinRAR archiving commands in context menu
      to create an archive with these files in the destination folder.

   3. It is possible to use WinRAR.ini file instead of Registry to store
      WinRAR settings. You may prefer such approach if you plan to install
      WinRAR to removable media, such as USB flash drive, and then run it
      on different computers.

      See "WinRAR.ini file" topic in "Configuration settings" chapter
      of WinRAR help for details.

   4. Added extraction support for ZIP and ZIPX archives using 
      XZ compression algorithm.

   5. If ZIP or ZIPX archive contains any compression algorithms except
      usual "Store" or "Deflate", algorithm names are displayed
      in "Version to extract" field of archive information dialog.
      Algorithms with names unknown to WinRAR will be assigned "m<num>"
      name, where "num" is a compression algorithm numeric identifier.

   6. "Open with WinRAR" command is available in Windows context menus
      for archive formats supported by WinRAR. It can be turned off
      with "Open with WinRAR (for usual archives)" option in WinRAR
      "Settings/Integration/Context menu items..." dialog.

   7. Command line RAR can read the default set of switches from rar.ini
      file stored in RAR program folder. Previously it was possible to
      define only the same set of switches for all RAR command with
      "switches=<switches>" string. Now rar.ini also allows to specify
      separate switch sets for individual RAR commands using
      the following syntax:

      switches_<command>=<any RAR switches, separated by spaces>

      For example:

      switches_a=-m5 -s
      switches_x=-o+

   8. Command "ch" supports switches -tl, -cu, -cl also for ZIP archives.
      Previously "ch" allowed these switches only for RAR archive format.

   9. For archive formats lacking file time information, such as .bz2,
      .xz and .Z, WinRAR sets container archive modification time
      to extracted files. It does not apply to tar.bz2, tar.xz and tar.Z,
      which use file time stored in tar headers.
   
  10. "Keep broken files" extraction option is supported for bzip2 archives.

  11. WinRAR icon in Windows context menus is scaled up correctly
      in high DPI screen modes such as 150% or 200% of normal text size.

  12. It is possible to disable WinRAR "Benchmark" command with
      "Benchmark" variable of HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\WinRAR\Policy
      Registry key. In multi-user environment "Benchmark" command might
      abuse shared computational resources. See "Registry variables" topic
      in "Configuration settings" chapter of WinRAR help for more details.

  13. Additionally to "sfxcmd" variable containing the entire command line,
      SFX module sets "sfxpar" variable containing command line parameters
      only, without leading SFX module name. These variables are set before
      starting a program specified in "Setup" command.

  14. File overwrite prompt in console RAR displays the size and modification
      time for existing and new files.

  15. When archiving from stdin with -si switch, RAR sets the current system
      time to modification time of archived file. Previous version did not
      set this time at all.

  16. It is possible to use -si and -v<size> switches together. Previous
      versions did not allow to create volumes when archiving from stdin.

  17. Warning is issued when starting unpacking 4 GB or larger file
      from RAR or ZIP archive to FAT32 patition, so user may cancel
      the operation. FAT32 does not support files of such size.

      Also this warning is issued when starting to create RAR archive
      with "Store" (-m0) method if estimated archive size is 4 GB or more.

  18. "Select all" button in "Settings/Integration" dialog is renamed to
      "Toggle all". Now it deselects archive formats if all they are
      already selected.

  19. "Delete archive" extraction option correctly removes all .zip and .7z
      volumes. Previously it removed only the first volume in the set
      for these archive formats.


   Version 5.11

   1. WinRAR can unpack TAR archives containing folders with pax
      extended headers. Previous versions failed to unpack them.

   2. "Keep broken files" extraction option is supported for 7-Zip archives.

   3. Bugs fixed:

      a) WinRAR 5.10 did not set "hidden", "read-only" and "system"
         file attributes when unpacking ZIP archives;

      b) WinRAR 5.10 failed to update self-extracting RAR archives
         containing nested ZIP archives stored without compression;

      c) ZIP archive created with "Do not store paths" option
         included unnecessary empty name records for folders;

      d) archived files could have 1 hour modification time error
         in Windows XP;

      e) deleting a file in RAR5 solid archive containing files stored
         with -ver switch caused such files to lose version information;

      f) black rectangles were displayed instead of toolbar buttons
         in 16- and 24- bit screen color modes and Windows custom text size
         larger than 100%.

   
   Version 5.10

   1. Added extraction support for ZIP and ZIPX archives using
      BZIP2, LZMA and PPMd compression.

   2. Added extraction support for 7z split archives
      (.7z.001, .7z.002, ...).

   3. Added support for AES-NI CPU instructions allowing to improve
      RAR encryption and decryption performance.

   4. Default theme images are scaled up with better quality
      in high DPI display mode.

   5. Environment variables, such as %temp%, can be used
      in "Files to add" field of archiving dialog.

   6. Switch -ai can be used when creating RAR archive,
      so predefined values, typical for file and folder,
      are stored instead of actual attributes.
      Previously this switch could be used only when extracting.


   Version 5.01

   1. RAR 5.0 archives can include an optional quick open information
      controlled with -qo[-|+] switch or "Quick open information" options
      group in archiving dialog. It allows to open the archive contents
      in WinRAR faster.

      This version provides better update performance for archives
      containing both quick open information and service records,
      such as NTFS file security. Also default parameters of quick open
      information are optimized to achieve faster open time for such archives.

   2. Bugs fixed:

      a) "Find" command could fail when searching text string in .7z archives;

      b) when opening RAR 5.0 archive with encrypted file names stored
         in another such archive, WinRAR could issue an erroneous message
         that password is incorrect. It happened only if passwords to inner
         and outer archives were different. It did not affect extraction,
         all files could be unpacked regardless of this message;

      c) option "Use for all archives" in password dialog did not suppress
         additional password requests for RAR 5.0 archives with encrypted
         file names;

      d) WinRAR address bar did not process correctly environment variable
         based paths, such as %temp%;

      e) storing NTFS file security and alternate data streams did not work
         for file pathnames longer than 260 characters;

      f) "Test" command could erroneously report damaged data in valid
         recovery record if only a part of files in RAR 5.0 archive
         was tested. It did not happen if entire archive contents was tested;

      g) "Test" command erroneously reported errors when verifying
         RAR 4.x Unix symbolic links;

      h) WinRAR "View" command did not work for files inside of BZIP2 archives;

      i) if "High precision modification time" option in archiving dialog
         was turned off, WinRAR did not store the modification time at all
         instead of storing a lower precision time;

      j) destination paths containing .\ or ..\ component did not work
         when extracting non-RAR archives in WinRAR command line mode;

      k) WinRAR failed to unpack multivolume CAB archives.


   Version 5.00

   1. New RAR 5.0 archiving format. You can use "RAR 5.0" option
      in archiving dialog or -ma command line switch to create
      RAR 5.0 archives.
      
      Older software including older WinRAR versions is not able to
      decompress RAR 5.0 archives, so if you plan to send an archive
      to other people, it is necessary to take the compatibility issue
      into consideration. You can select "RAR" instead of "RAR5" option
      in archiving dialog to create RAR 4.x archives compatible with
      previous WinRAR versions.

   2. Changes in RAR 5.0 compression algorithm:

      a) maximum compression dictionary size is increased up to 1 GB
         in 64 bit WinRAR. 32 bit WinRAR version can use up to 256 MB
         dictionary when creating an archive. Both 32 bit and 64 bit
         versions can unpack archives with any dictionary size,
         including 1 GB;

      b) default dictionary size for RAR 5.0 is 32 MB, typically resulting
         in higher compression ratio and lower speed than RAR 4.x 4 MB.
         You can use "Dictionary size" archiving dialog option or -md<size>
         switch to change this value;

      c) -md<size> switch syntax is modified to support larger dictionary
         sizes. Append 'k', 'm' and 'g' modifiers to specify the size
         in kilo-, mega- and gigabytes, like -md64m for 64 MB dictionary.
         If modifiers are not present, megabytes are assumed,
         so -md64m is equal to -md64;

      d) RAR 5.0 format includes Intel IA-32 executable and delta
         compression algorithms, but RAR 4.x text, audio, true color
         and Itanium algorithms are not supported. These excluded algorithms
         are not efficient for modern data types and hardware configurations;

      e) RAR 5.0 decompression can utilize several CPU cores.
         Though not to same extent as in compression algorithm,
         it improves the decompression speed on large files
         with poorly compressible data or when using BLAKE2 checksums.

   3. Changes in RAR 5.0 archive format:

      a) file times are stored as Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)
         instead of former local time, making file exchange among
         several time zones more straightforward;

      b) file names and archive comments use UTF-8 encoding.
   
   4. RAR 5.0 recovery record is based on Reed-Solomon error correction
      codes. If recovery record size is large enough, 5% and more,
      the new error correction scheme provides much higher resistance to
      multiple damages comparing to RAR 4.x recovery record.
      Smaller record, such as 1 - 2%, or less random damage type would
      result in less difference between 4.x and 5.0. For single continuous
      damage 4.x and 5.0 efficiency is about the same.

      Additionally to usual data erasures, the new recovery record
      is able to detect deletions and insertions of much larger size
      than in previous RAR versions. Maximum insertion size is several
      megabytes. Maximum deletion size depends on the damage type
      and in some cases can be as large as the recovery record size.
      
      Still, the best recovery performance and efficiency is achieved
      if no deletions and insertions are present, so all data including
      damaged sectors preserve their original positions. Thus, if you use
      some special software to copy an archive from damaged media,
      it is better to choose the mode, when damaged sectors are filled by
      zeroes or any other data instead of cutting them out completely
      from resulting file.

      RAR 5.0 recovery record is more resistant to damage of recovery record
      itself and can utilize a partially corrupt recovery record data.
      Note, though, that "Repair" command does not fix broken blocks
      in recovery record. Only file data are corrected. After successful
      archive repair, you may need to create a new recovery record
      for saved files.

      New recovery record is not based on 512 byte sectors anymore 
      and incorporates more complicated data structures. So it is impossible
      to specify its size in sectors. For RAR 5.0 archives the parameter of
      -rr[N] switch and rr[N] command is always treated as a percent of
      archive size regardless of presence of % character. Typically N%
      recovery record can repair up to N% of continuously damaged data
      and increases the archive size by only slightly more than N%.
      Ability to fix multiple damages is proportional to N.

      We used "Screaming Fast Galois Field Arithmetic Using Intel
      SIMD Instructions" paper by James S. Plank, Kevin M. Greenan
      and Ethan L. Miller to improve Reed-Solomon coding performance.
      Also we are grateful to Artem Drobanov and Bulat Ziganshin
      for samples and ideas allowed to make Reed-Solomon coding
      more efficient.

   5. "Test" command verifies validity of RAR 5.0 recovery record.
      Recovery record is tested after processing all archived files.

      If corrupt archive contains the recovery record, it might be possible
      to repair it even if recovery record validity test is failed.
      "Repair" command attempts to utilize even a partially damaged
      recovery record. So treat the negative recovery record test result
      as a reason to re-create the archive if original files are still
      available, but not as a reason to avoid "Repair" command.

   6. Changes in RAR 5.0 encryption algorithm:

      a) encryption algorithm is changed from AES-128 to AES-256 in CBC mode.
         Key derivation function is based on PBKDF2 using HMAC-SHA256;

      b) special password verification value allows to detect most of
         wrong passwords without necessity to unpack the entire file;

      c) if archive headers are not encrypted ("Encrypt file names" option
         is off), file checksums for encrypted RAR 5.0 files are modified
         using a special password dependent algorithm, to make impossible
         guessing file contents based on checksums. Do not expect such
         encrypted file checksums to match usual CRC32 and BLAKE2 values.
   
   7. RAR 5.0 archives allow to utilize 256 bit length BLAKE2sp hash
      ( https://blake2.net ) instead of 32 bit CRC32 as a file checksum.
      Enable "Use BLAKE2 file checksum" option in "Options" page of
      archiving dialog or specify -htb command line switch to use BLAKE2
      checksums.

      While producing slightly larger archives, BLAKE2 can be used
      for file contents identification. If two files have the same
      BLAKE2 value, it practically guarantees that file contents
      is the same. BLAKE2 error detection property is also stronger
      than in much shorter CRC32.

   8. Features removed:

      a) authenticity verification feature did not provide the required
         level of reliability and was removed;
      
      b) switch -en (do not add "end of archive" block) is not supported
         by RAR 5.0 archives, which always have the end of archive block.
         This block helps WinRAR to safely skip external data like
         digital signatures appended to archive;

      c) old style extension based arcname.rNN volume names are not
         supported by RAR 5.0 archives, which use only arcname.partN.rar
         volume names;
      
      d) file comments are not supported anymore both in RAR 4.x
         and RAR 5.0 archives. Console RAR 'cf' command is removed.
         It does not affect the archive comment support, which is present
         in both versions of archive format and is not planned for removal.

   9. "Set password" command and "Dictionary size" option are moved to
      "General" page of archiving dialog.
   
  10. You can use "Save symbolic links as links" option on "Advanced" page
      of archiving dialog to save and restore NTFS symbolic links
      and reparse points as links, so their contents is not archived.
      Command line equivalent of this option is -ol switch.

      Similar option for NTFS hard links is "Save hard links as links".
      Its command line equivalent is -oh switch.

      Both options are available only for RAR 5.0 archive format.
   
  11. Added extraction only support for XZ archive format.
   
  12. Changes in recovery volume processing in RAR 5.0 archive format:

      a) maximum number of RAR+REV volumes in RAR 5.0 format is 65535
         instead of 255;

      b) recovery volume operations are faster than in RAR 4.x;

      c) additionally to recovery data, RAR 5.0 REV files also store
         service information such as checksums of protected RAR files.
         So they are slightly larger than RAR volumes which they protect.
         If you plan to copy individual RAR and REV files to some removable
         media, you need to take it into account and specify RAR volume
         size by a few kilobytes smaller than media size.
  
  13. Maximum path length for files in RAR and ZIP archives is increased
      up to 2048 characters.
  
  14. Command line RAR returns the exit code 11 if it can detect that
      user entered a wrong password. This code can be returned only
      for RAR 5.0 archives. It is impossible to distinguish a wrong
      password and data damage for RAR 4.x archives.

  15. 'v' and 'l' commands display archived file names in the end of line,
      not in that beginning as before. Also some fields previously
      available in 'l' and 'v' output are now shown only by 'lt' and 'vt'.
      
      'vt' and 'lt' commands provide the detailed multiline information
      for every archived file.

      'vta' and 'lta' also include service headers into list.

   16. Now the default charset for filelists in commands like
       'rar a arcname @filelist' is ANSI for both WinRAR and console RAR.
       In previous versions it was ANSI for WinRAR and OEM for console RAR.
       You can use -sc<charset>l switch to override this default.

   17. Internal WinRAR viewer can detect and display files in UTF-8
       and UTF-16 little endian encodings.

   18. UTF-16 little endian encoding is used in RAR and WinRAR log file
       rar.log, so Unicode file names are stored in the log correctly.
       WinRAR automatically truncates the old rar.log file in non-Unicode
       format to avoid mixing different encoding in the same log file.
       In case of console RAR you need to delete the old rar.log manually,
       otherwide RAR will append UTF-16 messages to existing rar.log.

       You can use -sc<charset>g switch to change the default log file
       encoding, such as -scag for ANSI encoding.

   19. Command line 'r' (repair) command can include an optional destpath\
       parameter defining the destination folder for repaired archive:

       rar r archive.rar destpath\
      
   
   Version 4.20

   1. Changes in RAR compression:

      a) RAR general compression algorithm is optimized for better
         utilization of several processor cores. While some speed gain
         is possible even in single processor mode, best results
         are achieved in multi-core environment.

         Speed gain depends on data type and average file size.
         Several cores are utilized more efficiently when compressing
         large files.

      b) we had to increase memory requirements to achieve higher
         compression speed. General RAR compression algorithm allocates
         about 120 MB comparing to 40 MB in WinRAR 4.11;

      c) RAR text compression algorithm cannot utilize several CPU cores
         efficiently, so its performance in multiprocessor environment
         is much lower than for general algorithm. Also its decompression
         speed is much lower than in general algorithm regardless of
         CPU number. So we decided to disable the text algorithm by default.

         If you need maximum possible compression ratio for plain text data
         regardless of speed, you can enable the text compression
         in "Advanced compression parameter" dialog. Press "Compression..."
         button on "Advanced" page of archiving dialog to access it.
         You can also change this option permanently in default compression
         profile;

         In the command line mode the text compression can be enabled
         with -mct switch;

      d) "Fastest" (-m1) compression mode also supports several processor
         cores now. In 4.11 it could use only a single processor core.

   2. RAR general decompression algorithm speed is slightly improved,
      though not to same extent as RAR compression. RAR decompression
      is not able to use several processor cores, so its performance
      does not depend on a number of cores.

   3. Changes in ZIP compression:

      a) now ZIP compression supports several processor cores resulting
         in noticeably higher performance in multi-core environment.
         Single CPU ZIP compression is also faster than in 4.11;

      b) memory use for ZIP compression is increased to about 15 MB.

   4. Recovery volume creating and processing can use several CPU cores
      resulting in higher speed. Though, typically hard drive seek speed
      is a limiting factor for recovery volumes, so this gain is most
      noticeable when working with solid state drive.

   5. Now the allowed <threads> value for -mt<threads> switch is 1 - 32,
      not 0 - 16 as before.

   6. "Find files" command can search data in 7-Zip archives.
      Previously "Find files" did not support .7z archive format.

   7. Windows 2000 is not supported by WinRAR and WinRAR self-extracting
      modules anymore.

   8. "Save current settings" button in "Advanced SFX options" dialog
      is now available only when converting an existing archive to SFX.
      Options saved with this button are applied only to convert to SFX
      operation.

      If you create or update SFX archive, only SFX options stored
      in default compression profile are used. Options saved
      in "Advanced SFX options" dialog are ignored for these operations.


   Version 4.11

   1. Bugs fixed:

      a) WinRAR did not store NTFS "Compressed" attribute, when creating
         RAR archives;

      b) WinRAR crashed in command line mode if @filelist parameter 
         was present and 'filelist' did not exist. This bug affected
         only WinRAR.exe, not RAR.exe;

      c) if -x*\somefolder\* exclusion mask was specified when archiving 
         and if name of current folder contained 'somefolder', 
         WinRAR excluded all files and stopped creating an archive;

      d) GUI self-extracting archives did not work in Windows
         Preinstallation Environment (Windows PE).

   
   Version 4.10

   1. WinRAR can create ZIP archives of practically any size.

      2 GB archive size and 65535 file number ZIP limitations of previous
      WinRAR versions are not valid anymore.

   2. WinRAR can create multivolume ZIP archives, which are also known as
      split ZIP files.

      ZIP volumes have names like 'volname.zip', 'volname.z01', 'volname.z02'.
      Use a volume with ".zip" file extension in all archive processing
      operations like starting extraction or opening an archive.

      Unlike RAR volumes, ZIP volumes cannot be self-extracting.

      WinRAR needs to have access to all ZIP volumes of multivolume file set
      at the same time, when creating or unpacking them. So it is impossible
      to create or unpack ZIP volumes on removable disks, one volume
      per disk. You need to create them all in the same folder.

   3. Added the high precision file time support in ZIP archives.
      WinRAR can store and extract modification, creation and last access
      file time in ZIP archives with 100 nanosecond precision.

      You need to set "High precision modification time" option in "Time"
      part of archiving dialog to store all 3 times in archive.
      Set appropriate "File time" options in "Advanced" part of extraction
      dialog to choose times to extract.

   4. Added support for Unicode names stored in ZIP extra field data.
      Different ZIP tools store Unicode names either in file header
      or in ZIP extra field and now WinRAR can correctly process both types
      of Unicode names.

   5. "Synchronize archive contents" option and -as command line switch are
      supported in ZIP format.

   6. Modifications of switch -ag behavior:

      a) -ag can be used with all RAR and WinRAR commands, not just
         with archiving only;

      b) 'N' format character behavior differs in archiving and non-archiving
         operations. When archiving, it is incremented until the first unused
         name is found. In non-archiving operations like extracting it selects
         the existing archive preceding the first unused name;

      c) 'I' format character allows to specify minutes regardless of presence
         and position of 'H' (hours) in format string. It can be used
         instead of 'M' (minutes), when you wish to place minutes before hours
         or do not need hours at all.

   7. By default, WinRAR proposes to update an archive if viewer modified
      an opened file or created any new files. New "Ignore modifications for"
      option in "Settings/Viewer" dialog allows to disable such behavior.
      You can enter one or several file masks separated by spaces here
      and WinRAR will not prompt to update an archive if file created
      or modified by viewer matches one of these masks.

   8. Changes in volume size input field. Now you can select size units
      in the drop down list to the right of volume size. Previous way
      to define size modifiers, by entering 'k', 'm', etc. character
      after the numeric size value, is also supported.

   9. Changes in "Predefined sizes" in "Define volume sizes" dialog.
      Floppies and ZIP disks are replaced by 5 MB and 100 MB volumes,
      added new entries for maximum FAT32 file size and for Blu-ray disks.

  10. New "Wipe files if password is set" option in "Options" page of
      archiving dialog. If you prefer to always delete encrypted files
      securely, you can enable "Wipe files if password is set"
      in the default compression profile.

  11. New "Wipe temporary files/Encrypted only" option in "Settings/Security".
      It allows to use a slower and more secure delete for temporary files
      extracted from archives identified by WinRAR as encrypted.
      Quick delete is used for all other temporary files.

  12. Changes in "Convert archives" command:

      a) now it is possible to convert encrypted archives. Previously
         "Convert archives" command skipped them.

         Though, if you still prefer to skip them, you can do it
         by enabling "Skip encrypted archives" option in "Convert archives"
         dialog. It might be useful if you wish to run the conversion
         command in unattended mode, avoiding password prompts;

      b) special "rar2" archive type, which was specific for RAR 1.x
         and 2.x archives, is removed. Now "rar" archive type controls
         conversion of all versions of RAR archives.

         Since the convert command does not need to detect RAR archive
         version anymore, the initial search for archives is performed
         faster, resulting in shorter delay before displaying
         "Convert archives" dialog.

  13. New -log[fmt][=name] switch allows to write archive and file names
      to log file in archiving command for RAR and ZIP formats and also
      in extracting, deleting and listing commands for RAR format.

      This switch is especially useful, when you need to further process
      an archive created with -ag or -v switches, because -log provides
      the archive name generated by WinRAR.

  14. New -@[+] switch allows to process all parameters starting from
      '@' character either as file names (-@) or as file lists (-@+).

  15. "Setup program" SFX options are moved from "General" to "Setup" page
      of "Advanced SFX options" dialog. Both "Run after extraction"
      and "Run before extraction" are now multiline, so it is possible
      to specify several setup programs for same SFX archive.

  16. "SetupCode" SFX script command instructs SFX archive to wait
      for termination of setup program and return the exit code of
      setup program increased by 1000 as the exit code of SFX executable.

      GUI equivalent of this command is "Wait and return exit code" option
      on "Setup" page of "Advanced SFX options" dialog.

  17. SFX does not support "S" (create in the top level of Start Menu)
      "Shortcut" command mode anymore. Recent Windows versions do not allow
      programs to add items to the top of Start Menu.

  18. Volume size in archiving and wizard dialogs can be specified as
      a decimal fraction. Decimal mark is defined by Windows regional
      settings.

      -v<size> command line switch also allows decimal fractions.
      In command line mode the dot (.) is always used as the decimal mark.
      For example, -v1.5g switch means 1.5 gigabytes.


   Version 4.01

   1. Added support for file sizes stored in binary format in TAR archives.
      Some TAR archives use the binary size format instead of octal
      for files larger than 8 GB.
   
   2. Bugs fixed:

      a) "Repair" command failed to properly reconstruct structure
         of RAR archives, which contained at least one file with packed
         size exceeding 4 GB.

         This bug did not affect the recovery record based repair.
         It happened only if recovery record was not found and WinRAR
         performed reconstruction of archive structure;

      b) even if "Do not extract paths" option in "Advanced" part of
         extraction dialog was set as the default, WinRAR still unpacked
         file paths if called from Explorer context menu;

      c) after entering a wrong password for encrypted ZIP archive,
         sometimes WinRAR ignored subsequent attempts to enter a valid
         password;

      d) "Wizard" command did not allow to create self-extracting 
         and multivolume archives, when compressing a single folder
         or a file without extension;

      e) "Import settings from file" command did not restore multiline
         comments in WinRAR compression profiles;

      f) when converting RAR volumes having name1.name2.part#.rar name format,
         "Convert archives" command erroneously removed ".name2" name part.
         So resulting archive had name1.rar file name instead of expected
         name1.name2.rar;

      g) RAR could crash when creating a new archive with -agNNN switch
         if archive number in generated name was 110 or larger;

      h) WinRAR failed to display non-English file names in 7-Zip archives
         properly if they used a non-default code page. It was the display
         only problem, such names were unpacked correctly.


   Version 4.00

   1. RAR decompression speed is improved. Depending on data type,
      decompression can be up to 30% faster than in previous versions.

      Both the general RAR algorithm and most of special RAR multimedia
      methods benefit from this improvement. The only module of RAR
      algorithm, which is not affected, is "Text compression" method.

   2. Changes in ISO support:

      a) UDF support is upgraded to UDF 2.50 revision. It makes possible
         to unpack most of Blu-ray ISO files;

      b) when browsing UDF ISO file, UDF revision number is displayed
         after the "UDF" format name in WinRAR address bar
         and in archive information dialog;

      c) WinRAR sets the folder modification date when unpacking folders
         stored in UDF and ISO9660 files.
   
   3. Changes in password dialog:

      a) WinRAR uses the same format of password dialog both when archiving
         and extracting, so "Show password" option is available also
         when extracting;

      b) "Organize passwords..." button in password dialog provides
         access to password organizer interface, where you can specify
         your frequently used passwords. You will be able to access these
         saved passwords using the drop down list or autocomplete feature
         in password dialog.

         It is important to know that saved passwords are not encrypted
         and anybody having access to your computer can view them.
         Use "Organize passwords" feature only if your computer is
         protected from unauthorized access;

      c) "Use for all archives" option is available in password dialog
         when unpacking several archives at once. You can utilize it
         to apply an entered password to all archives.

         If you use this option with an empty password, WinRAR will skip
         all encrypted archives;

      d) Unlike previous versions, the password from default compression
         profile is not used for extraction.
         
         If you wish to use the same password for all extracting archives,
         press "Organize passwords..." button in the password dialog
         and define a new password entry, specifying "*" file mask 
         in "Select for archives" field.
   
   4. In Windows 7 WinRAR will display the total operation progress
      also on WinRAR icon on Windows taskbar. You can disable it using
      "Taskbar progress bar" option on "General" page of WinRAR settings.

   5. Numerous Unicode support improvements allow to process non-English
      file names more smoothly. These improvements include:

      a) better Unicode handling in WinRAR in "Rename", "Convert",
         "Find" and other commands, in folder tree panel, in password 
         request dialog and in many other parts of WinRAR interface;

      b) correctly displayed Unicode names in WinRAR items in Explorer
         context menus;

      c) Unicode support in .lng files, making WinRAR localization
         possible for Unicode only languages.
   
   6. Changes in -x<file> switch syntax. Now you can specify a wildcard
      exclusion mask for folders. Such mask must have the trailing '\'
      character, like -x*tmp*\ or -x*\temp\

   7. New "Extract relative paths" option in "Advanced" part of extraction
      dialog. If you browse some archive subfolder in WinRAR shell
      and enable "Extract relative paths" option, the path part up to
      and including the current subfolder will be removed from extracted
      file paths.
      
      For example, if you are inside of "Backup\MyData" archive folder
      and extract "Images" folder, it will be extracted as "Images",
      not as "Backup\MyData\Images".

      This option is the new default extraction mode, but you can change
      the default back to WinRAR 3.x style. Just select "Extract full paths"
      and then press "Save settings" in "General" part of extraction dialog.
   
   8. Windows 98, Windows Me and Windows NT are not supported by WinRAR
      and WinRAR self-extracting modules anymore. Minimum Windows version
      required for WinRAR 4.0 is Windows 2000.
      
      If you need to run WinRAR on older Windows, you can download
      previous WinRAR versions from ftp://ftp.rarlab.com/rar

   9. If TAR, TAR.GZ or TAR.BZ2 archive contains symbolic or hard links
      and if destination file system is NTFS, WinRAR will create these
      links when unpacking such archive. WinRAR will create symbolic links
      as symbolic and hard links as hard in Windows Vista and newer
      and it will create all links as hard in older Windows.

      If destination file system is FAT32 or any other not supporting
      file links, WinRAR will skip links when unpacking TAR, TAR.GZ
      and TAR.BZ2 archives.
   
  10. Recovery volume processing involves less disk seek operations
      resulting in higher performance.

  11. You can select Windows 7 library in tree panel in extraction dialog
      and WinRAR will use its default save location as the destination path.

  12. "Report" command allows to select HTML, Unicode text and usual text
      as output format for report file. Unlike previous WinRAR versions,
      now WinRAR preservers Unicode characters in reports when using HTML
      or Unicode text format. So non-English characters in file names
      will be displayed properly in such reports.
   
  13. Message list in GUI SFX archives displays only operation status
      and error messages. It does not contain names of all extracted files
      anymore. This change improves the speed and reduces memory requirements
      for SFX archives containing a large number of files. Also it makes
      easier to locate error messages, because they are not hidden among
      extracted file names.

  14. GUI SFX archives display "Extract" button instead of "Install"
      if no "Setup" or "Presetup" commands are present in the archive
      comment. If you prefer "Install" button, but do not need to
      execute any setup programs, you can add "Setup=<>" command.
  
  15. WinRAR displays the current percent above the operation progress bar
      when repairing an archive containing the recovery record
      and when processing recovery volumes.

  16. WinRAR limits the maximum possible volume size to 4 GB minus 1 byte
      when creating RAR volumes on a disk with FAT or FAT32 file system
      in volume size autodetecting mode. These file systems do not support
      4 GB and larger files.

  17. If "Wait if other WinRAR copies are active" option is enabled
      and WinRAR waits for another copy, you can press "Continue" button
      in command progress window to force WinRAR to stop waiting.
      So now "Continue" button allows to override the state of
      "Wait if other WinRAR copies are active" option for current operation.

  18. WinRAR displays one password request instead of two, when saving
      an encrypted file back to RAR or ZIP archive after modifying it
      in some external editor. Previous WinRAR versions usually requested
      the password twice, both when extracting the original file
      and archiving its modified copy. Only RAR archives with encrypted
      file names were processed with the single password prompt.

  19. New error code 10 ("no files") is added to list of error codes
      returned in command line mode by RAR and WinRAR. This new code
      can be returned by archive, extract, delete and repair commands.
      It means that RAR did not find any files matched the specified
      file or archive mask.
  
  20. File name area in file overwrite dialog occupies several lines now.
      It makes possible to display much longer names.
  
  21. Now switch -ep3 converts not only disk letters, but also UNC paths.
      So \\server\share will be converted to __server\share when archiving
      and restored to the original \\server\share when extracting with -ep3.

  22. New "Background extraction" option in "Advanced" part of extraction
      dialog places WinRAR into background, when extracting files.
      You can save its default state with "Save settings" button in "General"
      part of extraction dialog, just like for other extraction options.

      "Background archiving" option from the default compression profile
      does not affect the extraction behavior anymore.

  23. "Mode..." button in operation progress window is enabled also
      when extracting or testing archives. It provides access to 
      "Command parameters" dialog, where you can set "Turn PC off when done"
      option for extraction and test operations.

      Previously this dialog was accessible only when archiving.

  24. Bugs fixed:

      a) renaming a file in archive could also rename all other files
         with the same name in other folders of the same archive;

      b) previous versions displayed the wrong total packed size
         in "Info" command for multivolume CAB archives;

      c) in ZIP archives 'U' (update) and 'F' (fresh) commands could
         erroneously update even files not specified in the command line.
         It happened only for files in current folder which names matched
         files in ZIP archive. This bug was not present in usual 'A' (add)
         archiving mode.
